When preparing for a CMake-related interview, it's important to focus on the most commonly used CMake variables and functions. These are the ones you're most likely to encounter when configuring and building projects, defining targets, and managing dependencies. Here is a list of important CMake variables and functions that you should know:

1. Basic Variables:
CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR: The top-level directory of the source code.

Example: message(STATUS "Source directory: ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}")
CMAKE_BINARY_DIR: The directory where build files are stored (often the build directory).

Example: message(STATUS "Binary directory: ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}")
CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR: The source directory of the current CMakeLists.txt file being processed.

Example: message(STATUS "Current source directory: ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}")
CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR: The build directory for the current CMakeLists.txt file being processed.

Example: message(STATUS "Current binary directory: ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}")
CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD: Specifies the C++ standard version to use (e.g., C++11, C++14).

Example: set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: The directory where the project will be installed after running make install.

Example: set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "/usr/local")
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: The build configuration (e.g., Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo).

Example: set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release)
2. Important Functions:
File Management Functions:
include(): Includes a CMake script file, and processes it.

Example: include(FindBoost) (to include the Boost package).
find_package(): Searches for a package and sets variables accordingly.

Example: find_package(OpenGL REQUIRED)
file(): Allows you to perform file operations (copy, rename, read, etc.).

Example: file(COPY myfile.txt DESTINATION ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR})
Target-Related Functions:
add_executable(): Defines an executable target.

Example: add_executable(MyApp main.cpp)
add_library(): Defines a library target.

Example: add_library(MyLibrary STATIC mylibrary.cpp)
target_include_directories(): Specifies the include directories for a target.

Example: target_include_directories(MyApp PRIVATE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)
target_link_libraries(): Links libraries to a target.

Example: target_link_libraries(MyApp PRIVATE MyLibrary)
target_compile_definitions(): Defines preprocessor macros for a target.

Example: target_compile_definitions(MyApp PRIVATE MY_MACRO=1)
target_compile_options(): Adds specific compile options for a target.

Example: target_compile_options(MyApp PRIVATE -Wall)
target_sources(): Adds source files to a target.

Example: target_sources(MyApp PRIVATE mysource.cpp)
3. Configuration and Conditions:
if() / else() / elseif(): Used for conditional statements.

Example:
cmake
Copy code
if(MSVC)
    message(STATUS "Using MSVC compiler")
else()
    message(STATUS "Using a non-MSVC compiler")
endif()
set(): Defines or modifies a variable.

Example: set(MY_VARIABLE "some_value")
option(): Defines a boolean option that can be set by the user (e.g., through a CMake GUI or command line).

Example: option(BUILD_TESTS "Build tests" ON)
message(): Outputs a message (useful for debugging).

Example: message(STATUS "The value of MY_VARIABLE is: ${MY_VARIABLE}")
add_definitions(): Adds preprocessor definitions for all targets in the current CMakeLists.txt.

Example: add_definitions(-DDEBUG_MODE)

4. Build and Installation Functions:
add_subdirectory(): Adds a subdirectory to the project, useful for including other CMake-based projects or components.

Example: add_subdirectory(src)
install(): Specifies how to install files or targets.

Example:
cmake
Copy code
install(TARGETS MyApp DESTINATION bin)
install(FILES myfile.txt DESTINATION share/myapp)
export(): Used to export a target or variables for use in other CMake projects.

Example: export(TARGETS MyLibrary FILE mylibrary-targets.cmake)
5. Handling External Dependencies:
find_package(): Finds and sets up external dependencies like Boost, OpenGL, etc.

Example:
cmake
Copy code
find_package(Boost REQUIRED)
if(Boost_FOUND)
  include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
  target_link_libraries(MyApp Boost::Boost)
endif()
FetchContent: Downloads and integrates external content or dependencies during the configuration step.

Example:
cmake
Copy code
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  my_dependency
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/my-dependency.git
  GIT_TAG master
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(my_dependency)
6. Other Useful Functions:
message(): Prints messages to the console.

Example: message(STATUS "Project configured successfully!")
list(): Operates on lists (adding/removing items, checking existence, etc.).

Example: list(APPEND MY_LIST "item1" "item2")
string(): Performs string manipulations (e.g., replacing text, checking matches).

Example: string(TOUPPER "hello" MY_STRING)
7. CMake Generator Expressions:
Generator expressions are evaluated at build time rather than configure time. These are useful in more complex setups, such as when you want to specify different values based on build configurations.

Example:
cmake
Copy code
target_compile_definitions(MyApp
  PRIVATE
    $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:DEBUG_MODE>
)
This adds the DEBUG_MODE definition when building in Debug configuration.

8. Commonly Used Variables in CMake:
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS: Flags for the C++ compiler.
CMAKE_C_FLAGS: Flags for the C compiler.
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH: Path to search for packages.
CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS: Linker flags for executables.
CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS: Linker flags for shared libraries.
Summary:
In an interview, you should be familiar with these core CMake concepts:

Basic variables: CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR, CMAKE_BINARY_DIR, etc.
Important functions: add_executable(), add_library(), target_link_libraries(), find_package(), etc.
Conditional and configuration handling: if(), set(), option(), message().
External dependencies: find_package(), FetchContent.
Build system control: install(), add_subdirectory().
CMake generator expressions: target_compile_definitions() and other generator-based conditional setups.
By mastering these, you will be well-prepared to answer questions related to CMake and its usage in real-world projects.
