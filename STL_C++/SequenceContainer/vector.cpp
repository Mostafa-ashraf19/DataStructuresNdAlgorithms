Got it! Based on the job description you provided, here are the key technical topics you should focus on:

1. C++ Fundamentals
Syntax & Semantics: You need a solid understanding of C++ syntax (loops, conditionals, functions, classes, etc.).
Pointers & Memory Management: Understanding pointers, references, dynamic memory (new, delete), smart pointers (e.g., std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr), and the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principle.
Copying and Moving: Know how copy constructors, copy assignment operators, and move semantics work, particularly the role of std::move.
Namespaces: Understand how namespaces work and when to use them.
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction: Know the core principles of OOP and how to apply them in C++.
Access Specifiers: Understand public, private, and protected access control.
Constructors & Destructors: Understand the purpose of default, parameterized, and copy constructors, as well as destructors.
Virtual Functions and Inheritance: Be able to explain and use virtual functions, dynamic polymorphism, and the need for virtual destructors.
3. Design Patterns
Focus on common C++ design patterns:
Singleton: Understand the purpose and implementation of a Singleton.
Factory: Know how the Factory design pattern works.
Observer: Understand how it is used for event-driven programming.
Strategy and Command: These can be useful in game development, GUI applications, etc.
4. Standard Template Library (STL)
Containers: Be familiar with std::vector, std::list, std::deque, std::map, std::set, etc.
Algorithms: Understand common algorithms like std::sort, std::find, std::transform, etc.
Iterators: Understand the use of iterators with STL containers.
Function Objects and Lambdas: Be comfortable with using function objects and lambda functions.
Memory management with STL: Know how std::allocator works and how to use it.
5. WinAPI Basics
Basic Windows Programming: Know how to create a simple Windows application using the WinAPI (creating windows, handling messages, etc.).
Event Loop and Message Handling: Understand how message loops and message processing work in WinAPI.
Multithreading (in the context of WinAPI): Basic knowledge of creating threads using WinAPI (e.g., CreateThread, WaitForSingleObject, etc.).
6. Multithreading
Threading in C++: Be familiar with the C++11 threading model (std::thread, std::mutex, std::lock, std::atomic, etc.).
Synchronization: Know how to use mutexes, locks, and condition variables for thread synchronization.
Concurrency Issues: Be aware of race conditions, deadlocks, and how to avoid them.
7. CMake Basics
Basic CMake Commands: Understand CMakeLists.txt, add_executable(), add_library(), target_link_libraries(), etc.
Setting Compiler Options: Understand how to set different compiler flags for specific build configurations.
Cross-platform Build Configuration: Understand how CMake helps in building multiplatform C++ projects.
8. Cross-Platform Development
Multiplatform Development: Familiarity with writing portable C++ code across Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc.
Conditional Compilation: Use of preprocessor directives like #ifdef, #ifndef for platform-specific code.
Platform-Specific Libraries: Familiarity with common libraries that help with cross-platform development.
9. Additional Bonus Skills (Nice to Have)
Android Development: If you have any experience with Android NDK (Native Development Kit) or JNI (Java Native Interface), this could be a plus.
FreeRTOS: Knowing how to work with RTOS (Real-Time Operating Systems) like FreeRTOS could be a plus for embedded systems roles.
